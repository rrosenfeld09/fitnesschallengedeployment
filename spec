-*- 1) As a user, I would like a log in page so that when I log in, I can see all my past data logged.

-*- 2) As a user, I would like to pick a nickname, so when logged in, all my values will be tracked 
as the nickname

-*- 3) As a user, I would like a description page, so that if I forget the point values or the 
overall goal, I have somewhere to reference

-*- 4) As a user, I would like a 'Log It' page, where I can enter in what I did today and it 
automatically tracks the corresponding point value. 

-*- 5) As a user I would like a Leader-board page, where I can see the daily scores of everybody, 
so that I can see where I stand against my friends. This should be displayed in a table and chart format

-*- 6) As a user I would like to pick an avatar that is displayed in the leader-board. 
So that I can add some personal flair to my account
